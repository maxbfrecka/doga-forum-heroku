sun: 12/4/16

intervening week:

-music production stuff

sun: 12/11/16
-basic understanding of how the API actually works
-file upload with angular to folder
-understand request/response objects better
-added very basic upload page
Goals Tomorrow:
-finish file upload system a bit
-figure out file system and database a bit
-file types question (mp3? try to ask luis this)
-cookies, account system, database!
Notes:
It seems like the database system is central to this.
Understanding that will determine my success here.
A good database design will largely determine the possibilities of the site.
Also the backend/server is essential. Those things together will largely make the app run how it runs.

mon: 12/12/16
-upload basics
-mongodb up basically
-started planning sections
-create artist page
Questions:
-req/response objects as returning information
-understanding how the http header/body etc
-understanding how the error/next stuff works
-try to get a stronger grasp on multipart form data
-http focus
-take a closer look at res objects: resp.config.data etc
-evt?
Goals Tomorrow:
-access the data on the upload in the server
-perhaps basic add artist feature
-multipart.

tues: 12:13:16
-file upload functioning well
-filesystem in place
-basic database schema in place
-artist add in place
-artists
Goals Tomorrow:
-add album to artist
-add image to album
-add track/s to album (STORE IN TEMPS FOLDER THEN MOVE UPON PUBLISHING)
-convert tracks to mp3 and put into album folder
-playback

wed: 12:14:16
-artist/album/track schemas working
-can add an album
-add track system working, basically...
URGENT NOTES:
-a good guess for the reason sometimes things are goofing
-on album upload is that the artists aren't refreshing
Goals Tomorrow:
-get the file upload to work without skipping... figure out why that is happening
-tracks should be named by their ID and then extension added
-consider file conversion
-file playback
-display albums, display artists, link things, display tracks
-playback music, wire up controller
