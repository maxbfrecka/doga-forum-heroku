-angular-audio in the bower installation seemed to have a question about the angular version in use, didn't respond to install it in angular version...again...
-bower resolutions?




- not sure why audio won't play
- it plays when the tab is changed! which means that the window itself may be triggering something.
- also when that restart thing is altered, ($willRestart = false when the track is restarted...)
-the track plays as well.
-the track seems to show it is playing at any given point.
-perhaps it's currenttime etc

-it also plays fine when debugging. something isn't being triggered in the code which is causing the problem!


when this is removed, the problem seems to to away... why does this happen when changing windows?
if (newValue.currentTime !== oldValue.currentTime) {
                    audioObject.setCurrentTime(newValue.currentTime);
                }


                place this at line 237: in ngAudio to test
                console.log('old value')
                    console.log(oldValue.currentTime)
                    console.log('new value')
                    console.log(newValue.currentTime)
                    console.log('audio.currentTime')
                    console.log(audio.currentTime)
                    console.log('audioObject.currentTime')
                    console.log(audioObject.currentTime)


                    at line 322 :audioObject.currentTime = audio.currentTime;
                    the observe feature... something is going wrong...
                    audio.currentTime is setting the audioObject.currentTime and it is glitching
                    perhaps due to window? no idea

                    this.setCurrentTime = function(currentTime) {
            if (audio && audio.duration) {
                console.log('?');
                audio.currentTime = currentTime;
            }
        };


these are problems
